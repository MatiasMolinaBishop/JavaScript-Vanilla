//1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2')

// const players1 = game.players[0];
// const players2 = game.players[1];

//We can also deconstructor the players array within the game object.

console.log("DESTRUCTURING:");
console.log("ARRAY OF PLAYERS AT INDEX 0: ", players1);
console.log("ARRAY OF PLAYERS AT INDEX 1: ", players2);
console.log("FOR UNDERSTANDING", number);

//2. The first player in any player array is the goal keeper and the others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1)
//create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players

//For this excerise we use the spread operator and we deconstruct the players1 arr to get the data out and save it in different new variables.
//Because arr are oredered, the order in which we deconstruct matters. Therefore, gk will save the name saved on the arr index 0.
//...fieldPlayers spreads all remaining data on players1 arr and saves it as a new arr under fieldPlayers variable. NOTE the name is whatver comes after thr ...
const [gk, dl, dr, dc, ...fieldPlayers] = players1;

//3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)

//const allPlayers = [...game.players[0], ...game.players[1]];
//NOTE We can also use the variables we created players1 & players2 from question 1
//Finally if we had done  allPlayers = [...players1, players2]; then all players in players2 would have been inside an arr within allPlayers. So we spread
const allPlayers = [...players1, ...players2];
console.log(allPlayers);

//4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players.
//So create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'

const players1Final = [...players1, "Thiago", "Coutinho", "Perisic"];

//5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')

// console.log(team1);
// console.log(draw);
// console.log(team2);
